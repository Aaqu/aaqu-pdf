## Features

- Accepts a PDF document as a `Buffer` in `msg.payload`.
- Page number can be set either in the **node configuration** or dynamically via `msg.pdfPage`.
- Outputs a new `Buffer` containing a PDF with only the selected page.
- Simple integration with existing Node-RED flows.
- Convert pdf page to base64

---

## Installation

Run the following command inside your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

```bash
npm install @aaqu/node-red-aaqu-pdf
```

Then restart Node-RED and the new node will appear in the editor palette.
